The TOP500 project ranks and details the 500 most powerful non-<a href>distributed computer</a> systems in the world.
 The project was started in 1993 and publishes an updated list of the supercomputers twice a year. The first of these 
updates always coincides with the <a href>International Supercomputing Conference </a>in June, and the second is presented at the 
<a href>ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference </a>in November. The project aims to provide a reliable basis for tracking and detecting 
trends in high-performance computing and bases rankings on HPL,[1] a portable implementation of the high-performance 
LINPACK benchmark written in Fortran for distributed-memory computers.</p1><br>
<center><img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\220px-Top500_logo.png"><br></center>
<p2 style=" font-size:30pt;">China currently dominates the list with 206 supercomputers, leading the second place (United States) by a record margin of 82.
[2] In the most recent list (June 2018), the<a href> American Summit</a> is the world's most powerful supercomputer, reaching 122.3 
petaFLOPS on the LINPACK benchmarks.</p2>
<p3 style=" font-size:30pt;">The TOP500 list is compiled by Jack Dongarra of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Erich Strohmaier and Horst 
Simon of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and <a href>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
(LBNL)</a>, and from 1993 until his death in 2014, Hans Meuer of the University of Mannheim, Germany.
<h1> History</h1>
<h1>_______</h1>
<p4 style=" font-size:30pt;">In the early 1990s, a new definition of supercomputer was needed to produce meaningful statistics. 
After experimenting with metrics based on processor count in 1992, the idea arose at the <a href>University of Mannheim </a>
to use a detailed listing of installed systems as the basis. In early 1993, Jack Dongarra was persuaded to join the 
project with his <a href>LINPACK benchmarks</a>. A first test version was produced in May 1993, partly based on data available 
on the Internet, including the following sources:[3][4]</p4><br>

<ul>David Kahaner, the director of the Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP);[6] published a report in 1992,
 titled "Kahaner Report on Supercomputer in Japan"[4] which had an immense amount of data.[citation needed]</ul>
<p5 style=" font-size:30pt;">Since 1993, performance of the No. 1 ranked position has grown steadily in accordance with <a href>Moore's law</a>, doubling 
roughly every 14 months. As of June 2018, <a href>Summit</a> was fastest with an Rpeak[7] of 187.6593 PFLOPS. For comparison, this 
is over 1,432,513 times faster than the Connection <a href>Machine CM-5/1024 (1,024 cores)</a>, which was the fastest system in
 November 1993 (twenty-five years prior) with an Rpeak of 131.0 GFLOPS.[8]</p5>
<h1>Architecture and operating systems <h1>
<h1>________________________________</h1>
<p7 style=" font-size:30pt;">As of June 2018, TOP500 <a href>supercomputers</a> are now all 64-bit, mostly based on x86-64 CPUs
(Intel EMT64 and AMD AMD64 instruction set architecture), with few exceptions (all based on reduced instruction
 set computing (RISC) architectures) including 15 supercomputers based on Power Architecture used by <a href>IBM POWER</a> 
microprocessors, six SPARC (all with Fujitsu-designed SPARC-chips, one of which—the K computer—surprisingly made
 the top in 2011 without a GPU, currently ranked 16th, while only dropping to 3rd on the HPCG list[9]), and two,
 seemingly related, Chinese designs: the ShenWei-based (ranked 11 in 2011, ranked 158th in November 2016) and 
< a href>Sunway SW26010-based</a> ranked 1 in 2016, making up the remainder (another non-US design is PEZY-SC, while it is an 
accelerator paired with Intel's Xeon). Before the <a href>ascendance of 32-bit x86</a> and later <a href>64-bit x86-64</a> in the early 2000s, a 
variety of RISC processor families made up most <a href>TOP500 supercomputers</a>, including RISC architectures such as <a href>SPARC,
 MIPS, PA-RISC, and Alpha</a>.</p7><br>

<h1>Legend</h1>
<p8 style=" font-size:30pt;"><ul>

<li>Rank – Position within the TOP500 ranking. In the TOP500 list table, the computers are ordered first by their Rmax value. In the case of equal performances (Rmax value) for different computers, the order is by Rpeak. For sites that have the same computer, the order is by memory size and then alphabetically.</li>
<li>Rmax – The highest score measured using the LINPACK benchmarks suite. This is the number that is used to rank the computers. Measured in quadrillions of floating point operations per second, i.e., petaFLOPS.</li>
<li>Rpeak – This is the theoretical peak performance of the system. Measured in PFLOPS.</li>
<li>Name – Some supercomputers are unique, at least on its location, and are thus named by their owner.</li>
<li>Model – The computing platform as it is marketed.</li>
<li>Processor – The instruction set architecture or processor microarchitecture.</li>
<li>Interconnect – The interconnect between computing nodes.</li>
<li>Vendor – The manufacturer of the platform and hardware.</li>
<li>Site – The name of the facility operating the supercomputer.</li>
<li>Country – The country in which the computer is located.</li>
<li>Year – The year of installation or last major update.</li>
<li>Operating system – The operating system that the computer uses.</li></ul></p8>

<h1> New Development in supercomputer<h1>
<p12 style=" font-size:30pt;">On 29 July 2015, President Obama signed an executive order creating a National Strategic Computing Initiative calling for the accelerated development of an exascale (1000 petaflop) system and funding research into post-semiconductor computing.[31]</p12>
